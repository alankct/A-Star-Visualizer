"""
A* algorithm is a better performing extension of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm in that it can be used to
find the shortest path from point A to B, all while achieving better performance through the use
of heuristics to guide its search. 

At each iteration of its main loop, A* figures out which of its paths to extend. It does so based
on the cost of a path and the estimated cost required to extend this path all the way to the goal. 

Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

... where n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, 
and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the direct path from n to the goal.

Space: O(n)
Time: O(nlogn)

The space complexity of A* is roughly the same as that of all other graph search algorithms, as it
keeps all generated nodes in memory. In practice, this turns out to be the biggest drawback of A*
search, leading to the development of memory-bounded heuristic searches, such as Iterative deepening
A*, memory bounded A*, and SMA*.
